STORY = "You wake up on the sidewalk cold, wet, broke, slightly horney.
And stuck inside a bubble. Welcome to Boulder! How the hell
did you get here? You came in search of legal weed, mountains and start-up dreams
and now find yourself, on the corner of 9th and Pearl, sharing a blanket and snuggled up
with a dude called Feld.

Different than The Dude, although Feld does abide!

You recall reading something about this guy Feld and his super human powers.
Rumor has it, if you give him $10 and he matches it with his $10,
he can magically turn that $20 into $70 Million and give you your $10 back! Feld can be your ticket
out of here. You try to wake his ass up. He finally comes to life and
starts to put on his running shows. Whoa, whoa, whoa Feld. Not so fast. You need to help me break out of
of this bubble and maybe bag some VC cash along the way! Feld smiles, puts on his glasses, and
says Yes, I can help you break out of Boulder, but it's not going to be easy...and it's going
to cost you 85%!"
