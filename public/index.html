    You wake up on the sidewalk cold, wet, broke, slightly horny.
    And stuck inside a bubble. Welcome to Boulder! How the hell
    did you get here? You came in search of legal weed, mountains and start-up dreams
    and now find yourself, on the corner of 9th and Pearl, sharing a blanket and snuggled up
    with a dude called Feld.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Different than The Dude, although Feld does abide!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You recall reading something about this guy Feld and his super human powers.
    Rumor has it, if you give him $10 and he matches it with his $10,
    he can magically turn that $20 into $70 Million and give you your $10 back! Feld can be your ticket
    out of here. You try to wake his ass up. He finally comes to life and
    starts to put on his running shoes. Whoa, whoa, whoa Feld. Not so fast. You need to help me break out of
    of this bubble and maybe bag some VC cash along the way! Feld smiles, puts on his glasses, and
    says Yes, I can help you break out of Boulder, but it's not going to be easy...and it's going
    to cost you 85%!
